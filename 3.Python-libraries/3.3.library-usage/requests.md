The requests library is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python.

<br>

_Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic._

**The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests in Python, which is useful for interacting with web APIs or web scraping.**
