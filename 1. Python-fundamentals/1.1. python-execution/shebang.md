In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.

### welcome.py

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello Academy!")
```

### Shebang execution

```
[!bash!]$ chmod +x welcome.py
[!bash!]$ ./welcome.py

Hello Academy!
```
